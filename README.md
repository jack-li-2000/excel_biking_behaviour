Summary

This project analyzes customer biking behaviour using demographic, geographic, and lifestyle variables to uncover patterns in purchasing decisions and riding habits. The dataset includes factors such as marital status, education level, continent, and number of cars owned per household, alongside purchase and survey data. Interactive Excel dashboards visualize insights such as average income of purchasers (segmented by gender), age group distribution of bike purchases, and customer commute distance preferences.

Hypothesis

* Demographics Influence Purchases ‚Äì Marital status, education level, and household car ownership affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
* Income & Gender Trends ‚Äì Average income differs between male and female purchasers.
* Age & Commute Distance ‚Äì Younger buyers may be more likely to purchase bikes for shorter commutes, while older buyers may prefer leisure or fitness use.

Methods

Data Source: Customer survey and purchase dataset (CSV/Excel format).

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts, Conditional Formatting)

Process:

Data Cleaning ‚Äì Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized categorical variables (e.g., marital status, education).
Feature Engineering ‚Äì Created calculated fields for age groups, commute distance categories, and income brackets.
Exploratory Analysis ‚Äì Used pivot tables to segment data by demographic and behavioural variables.
Dashboard Creation ‚Äì Built interactive dashboards with slicers for gender, continent, and education level to allow dynamic filtering.

Conclusion

Income Patterns ‚Äì Clear differences in average income between genders and across education levels.
Demographic Insights ‚Äì Married individuals and those with higher education levels showed higher bike purchase rates.
Commute Behaviour ‚Äì Most purchasers reported short-to-medium commute distances, suggesting a mix of commuting and recreational use.
Market Implications ‚Äì Targeted marketing could focus on high-income, educated demographics in regions with shorter commute distances.
